# Assessment Grading Rubric
## Short Response Section
### Technical Score
* **3**: A score of 3 indicates that a response is technically sound, accounts for edge cases, and uses the correct vocabulary.
* **2**: A score of 2 indicates that, generally, your response is technically sound but may be missing some detail or is being communicated with overly general language.
* **1**: A score of 1 indicates that you have left out or incorrectly communicated an important concept. A score of 1 indicates that you have a significant knowledge gap that you must revisit.
* **0**: Questions receive a 0 if they are left blank or are completely incorrect, technically.

### Writing Score
* **3**: A score of 3 indicates that your communication is clear, concise, and typo/grammar error free. In a word, 3 stands for _flawless_.
* **2**: A response would receive a 2 if there are minor typos/grammar errors OR if a response is long-winded or slightly unclear.
* **1**: A response receives a 1 if there are multiple or major spelling/grammer errors OR if your response was so unclear that it is difficult to infer your main idea.
* **0**: Questions receive a 0 if they are left blank or answered with disrespectfully low effort.

## Code Katas
### Algorithm Score
* **3**: Your algorithm solves the problem efficiently and it is implemented correctly.
* **2**: Your algorithm solves the problem but does so in an inefficient manner OR your algorithm has a minor error in implementation.
* **1**: There is a major or multiple minor errors in the implementation of your algorithm.
* **0**: Your algorithm will not produce a solution to the given problem.

### Code Style
* **3**: Your code is readable, conventional, and utilizes ES6 features to enhance readability efficiency. All variables and functions are thoughtfully named.
* **2**: Your code has minor style errors (spacing, quotations, etc).
* **1**: Your code has multiple style errors or poorly named variables. 
* **0**: Your code has syntax errors.
